# Project Progress Report

## Repository Creation

- We have successfully created a GitHub repository for our project.
- This repository serves as a central location for collaboration, version control, and tracking changes.

## Team Discussion & Planning

- The team met to discuss project goals and outline the necessary features.
- Tasks were assigned to each member based on their strengths and interests.

## Feature Assignments

- **Code Cleanup:**  
  - Assigned to a team member to refactor and organize the existing codebase.
  - This will improve readability, reduce bugs, and make future development much easier.
  - Clean code ensures that new features can be added with less risk of breaking existing functionality.

- **Leaderboard Feature:**  
  - Another member is responsible for implementing a leaderboard.
  - This will track and display high scores, adding a competitive element to the game.

- **Game Mechanics Fixes:**  
  - Specifically, one member is tasked with fixing issues related to how new blocks appear on the screen.
  - This will improve gameplay and ensure a smoother user experience.
