<!-- Slide 2 -->
## Repository Creation

- Successfully created a GitHub repository for our project.
- Central location for collaboration, version control, and tracking changes.

---

<!-- Slide 3 -->
## Team Discussion & Planning

- Team met to discuss project goals and outline necessary features.
- Tasks assigned to each member based on strengths and interests.

---

<!-- Slide 4 -->
## Team Decisions on AI

- Team members decided to use AI as a tool to write tests, do refactoring, and to accelerate progress.
- This is important because it allows team members to "own" their code and also work at a faster pace

## Feature Assignments

### Code Cleanup & Variable Renaming
- Assigned to a team member to refactor and organize the existing codebase.
- Improves readability, reduces bugs, and eases future development.
- Requirments :  
    1. Rename unclear variables/functions and reformat code to consistent style guide.
    2. Refactor duplicated code (e.g., piece rotation, collision checks) into reusable

## Feature Assignments (cont.)

### Leaderboard Feature
- Another member is implementing a leaderboard.
- Tracks and displays high scores, adding a competitive element.
    1. Requirement : Store data so that the leaderboard maintains even when app closes

## Feature Assignments (cont.)

### Game Mechanics Fixes
- One member is fixing issues with how new blocks appear on the screen.
- Improves gameplay and ensures a smoother user experience.
- Feature : Making the logic to add, update, and remove items & show next block before its on screen
    1. Requirement: Implement logic to manage the lifecycle of Tetris blocks (add new blocks, update their positions, and remove them when placed). Display a "next block" preview so players can see which block will appear after the current one.

## Benefits of Our Approach

- **Clear Assignments:** Each member knows their responsibilities, streamlining development and avoiding overlap.
- **Improved Codebase:** Early code cleanup saves time and effort in the long run.
- **Feature-Focused Development:** Early assignments ensure steady progress and accountability.

## Milestones and Deadlines

- **Finish code cleanup:** 9/28
- **Fix next block functionality:** 10/1
- **Add leaderboard:** 10/8

<!-- Slide 10 -->
## Next Steps

- Continue development on assigned features.
- Regularly merge changes into the main branch.
- Hold weekly check-ins to review progress and address any blockers.
